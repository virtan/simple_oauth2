simple_oauth2
==============

Simple OAuth2 client for any http server framework
Inspired by and based on https://github.com/dvv/social
Preconfigured to authorize users of Google, Facebook, Yandex, Vkontakte


Usage
--------------

1. Create OAuth2 web site app keys at
  Google: https://code.google.com/apis/console/b/0/
  Facebook: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/
  Yandex: https://oauth.yandex.ru/client/new
  Vkontakte: http://vk.com/dev

2. Integrate into you http server framework

   Example for MochiWeb (https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb):

      SocNets = simple_oauth2:customize_networks(simple_oauth2:predefined_networks(), [
              {<<"google">>, [
                      {client_id, <<"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID">>},
                      {client_secret, <<"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET">>}
                  ]},
              {<<"yandex">>, [
                      {client_id, <<"YANDEX_CLIENT_ID">>},
                      {client_secret, <<"YANDEX_CLIENT_SECRET">>}
                  ]},
              {<<"vkontakte">>, [
                      {client_id, <<"VK_CLIENT_ID">>},
                      {client_secret, <<"VK_CLIENT_SECRET">>}
                  ]},
              {<<"facebook">>, [
                      {client_id, <<"FB_CLIENT_ID">>},
                      {client_secret, <<"FB_CLIENT_SECRET">>}
                  ]}
          ]),
      UrlPrefix = iolist_to_binary([atom_to_list(Req:get(scheme)), "://",
              Req:get_header_value("host")]),
      {_, QS, _} = mochiweb_util:urlsplit_path(Req:get(raw_path)),
      case simple_oauth2:dispatcher(iolist_to_binary([Call, <<"?">>, QS]), UrlPrefix, SocNets) of
          {redirect, Where} -> Req:respond({302,
                      [{"Location", simple_oauth2:gather_url_get(Where)}], []});
          {send_html, HTML} -> Req:ok({"text/html; charset=utf-8", HTML});
          {ok, AuthData} -> Req:ok({"text/plain; charset=utf-8", io_lib:format("~p~n", [AuthData])});
          {error, Class, Reason} ->
              Req:ok({"text/plain; charset=utf-8", io_lib:format("Error: ~p ~p~n", [Class, Reason])})
      end.

3. Start ssl and inets erlang applications before

You can easily add more social networks (see simple_oauth2:predefined_networks()) with OAuth2 authorization.
